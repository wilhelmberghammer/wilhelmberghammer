### Hello there 👋

- 🎓 I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz.

- 👨‍💻 I also work at [LeadEngine GmbH](https://github.com/LeadEngine-GmbH) as a data scientist. There, I'm currently working on tools to analyse organic searches to better measure SEO success and to futher close the gap between SEO and SEA for more efficient use of ad budgets.
