### Hello there 👋

- 🎓 I'm currently studying Artificial Intelligence at JKU Linz.

- 💡 I'm very interested in Machine Learning Applications in Physics.

- 👨‍💻 I also work at [LeadEngine GmbH](https://github.com/LeadEngine-GmbH) as a data scientist. There, I'm currently working on tools to analyse organic search data to better measure SEO success. For example, by probabilistically attributing conversions to search queries.
